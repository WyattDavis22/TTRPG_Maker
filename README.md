# TTRPG Maker 
(This application is currently being developed in a repositiory for Grand Valley State University)

A web application designed to make it easier for GMs of table-top RPGs to run their own, homebrewed games.

More specifically, this app should provide interfaces for a campaign's GM to:
* Create their own game; which includes a world, quests, player characters, and non-player characters
* Add a map to their world, which they can place towns and landmarks on
* Add maps to their towns, which they can place local landmarks (such as shops) on
* Add items that can be stocked to shops
* Manage their characters (both player and non-player)
* Manage the quests within their games

It should also allow players to:
* Create a player character and join a game
* Manage their characters' inventories, levels, etc.
* Take both public and private notes on characters, quests, towns, etc.
* Interact with landmarks (buy and sell from shops, estimate distances and travel times, etc.)
